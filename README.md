# TalkPix — AI talking photo resources

[TalkPix](https://www.talkpix.ai) turns one portrait and a short script (or an audio clip) into a lip-synced MP4 video in the browser. This repository collects the practical material we point people to: a photo checklist, copy-and-edit scripts, a developer API quick start and the current product facts.

## Photo checklist for clean lip sync

The model animates the mouth it can see, so most weak results trace back to the photo rather than the script.

1. **One face, facing the camera.** A slight angle is fine; a side profile is not.
2. **The whole mouth is visible.** No hand, microphone, scarf or paw over the lips.
3. **The face fills a good part of the frame.** A small face in a group or landscape shot gives a stiff, barely moving mouth.
4. **Even light on the face.** A hard shadow across the mouth reads as a closed mouth.
5. **Old photos:** crop to the person, straighten the scan and use the sharpest copy you have. Scratches away from the face don't matter.
6. **Pets:** a close-up with the muzzle pointed at the lens, head upright, mouth slightly open. Lying poses with the chin on the paws barely move.

## Script templates

People speak roughly 2 to 2.5 words per second, so a 20-second video fits about 45–50 words. Write the way the person would actually talk: short sentences, contractions, one idea per line.

**Birthday**

```text
Happy birthday, [name]! I can't believe another year went by already.
I hope today is loud, messy and full of cake. I'm so proud of you. See you soon!
```

**Old family photo**

```text
Hello, [name]. This picture was taken in [year], in [place].
I'd love for you to know how much this family meant to me. Keep the stories going.
```

**Pet**

```text
Listen, human. The bowl is half empty, which means it is completely empty.
Also, I love you. But mostly the bowl.
```

**Small shop**

```text
Hi, I'm [name] from [shop]. Every [product] is made by hand in [city].
Order before Friday and it ships the same week.
```

For another language, type the script in that language and choose a voice for it.

## Developer API quick start

Renders can also be started from your server with the REST API. Create a key in your TalkPix account; API renders use the same credit wallet and rates as the web app, and credits are reserved before each render.

```bash
curl https://www.talkpix.ai/api/v1/videos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tpx_live_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image_url": "https://example.com/portrait.jpg",
    "script": "Hi! This video was made with one API call.",
    "voice": "zephyr",
    "language": "en-US",
    "webhook_url": "https://example.com/hooks/talkpix"
  }'
```

Poll `GET /api/v1/videos/{id}` or wait for the webhook, then download `video_url`. Keep the key on your server, never in a browser or mobile app. Full reference: [talkpix.ai/developers](https://www.talkpix.ai/developers)

## Responsible use

Only animate photos you have the right to use, with consent from the people in them (or their family, for someone who has passed away). Don't pass a generated clip off as a real recording of someone. Full rules: [Terms](https://www.talkpix.ai/terms)
